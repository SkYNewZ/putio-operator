# putio-operator

Manage your [Put.io](https://app.put.io/) RSS feeds with Kubernetes Custom Resources.

[![Go](https://github.com/SkYNewZ/putio-operator/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SkYNewZ/putio-operator/actions/workflows/main.yml)

## Usage

Before creating an RSS feed resource, you must configure a secret containing an OAuth2 token to interact with Put.io
API. You can get one here https://app.put.io/account/api/apps/new.

Then, place the OAuth2 token into a Kubernetes secret. For example :

```
kubectl -n default create secret generic putio-token --from-literal=token=<your oauth2 token>
```

Then, you can create RSS feed by specifying this secret. You can see examples [here](config/samples/_v1alpha1_feed.yaml)
.

```yaml
apiVersion: skynewz.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Feed
metadata:
  name: house-of-the-dragons
  namespace: default
spec:
  keyword: "House.of.the.Dragon.S01E&.MULTi.1080p.WEB.H264-FW"
  rss_source_url: "https://rss.site.fr/rss?id=2184"
  delete_old_files: false
  title: "House of the Dragon"
  paused: true
  parent_dir_id: 1022542820 # 'House of the Dragon' folder
  dont_process_whole_feed: true
  authSecretRef:
    key: putio-token
    name: token

```

The `kubectl get feeds` output will give you

```
NAME                           KEYWORD                                                                        LAST FETCH   PAUSED   TITLE                           AGE
house-of-the-dragons           House.of.the.Dragon.S01E&.MULTi.1080p.WEB.H264-FW                              20h          true     House of the Dragon             2d2h

```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for
testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever
cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster

1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/putio-operator:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/putio-operator:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs

To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller

UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```
